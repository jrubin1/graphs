I am failing only the A* tests in PathTest. There seems to be an infinite loop in my pathTo, which is cause by my prevs arrayList
(the ArrayList to hold predecessors) not being filled correctly. However, it is only not filled correctly on the A* test.
When I debugged it for the previous path tests, the prevs arrayList was filled correctly. I am not sure what exactly is going wrong
or how to fix it.
